## TCP

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on devices connected to a network. TCP establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before data transmission and ensures that all data packets are received in the correct order, retransmitting any packets that are lost or corrupted in transmission. This makes TCP ideal for applications that require high reliability and accuracy, such as file transfers, email, and web browsing.

## UDP

UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides fast and lightweight delivery of data, but without any reliability or ordering guarantees. UDP does not establish a connection before data transmission and does not retransmit any lost or corrupted packets. This makes UDP ideal for applications that prioritize speed and low latency, such as online gaming, video streaming, and real-time communication.

## MAC Address

MAC addresses are unique identifiers assigned to network interface controllers (NICs) of network devices such as computers, routers, and switches. They are used to uniquely identify a device on a network, and they are permanent and cannot be changed. MAC addresses are used in the process of delivering data packets between devices on the same network, and help to prevent collisions in data transmission.
